        This paper investigates regulatory distortion in the incentives to invest in transmission capacity in the United States natural gas pipeline network. We are motivated by the fact that trade of gas between states should temper regional price variation. However, price differences between locations frequently exceed the marginal cost of transmission, indicating that capacity constraints are binding. Gas pipelines are tightly regulated through both rate-of-return for pricing and a costly approval process, both of which could distort the firms' investment incentives. When combined, the two sides of the regulatory structure could be used in tandem to design incentives that promote efficient network growth. To understand how well the policy aligns incentives with social value, we develop a structural model of a pipeline firm's dynamic investment problem and estimate it nonparametrically using debiased machine learning. We then construct a measure of the social value of pipeline capital, based on a social planner model that ties the value of capacity expansion to regional price gaps. In most areas, the incentives of firms to invest under fixed rates of return exceed the social value of capital, highlighting the importance of costly approvals as a secondary tool to control investments. Even for a range of discount factors that rationalize the observed policy on average, there are systematic deviations from the optimal policy both spatially and intertemporally. We suggest a welfare improving reallocation of regulatory costs that would streamline the approval process in certain parts of the northeast, but shift focus toward the southeast and parts of the mountain west.

      This paper investigates regulatory distortion in the incentives to invest in transmission capacity in the United States natural gas pipeline network. We are motivated by the fact that trade of gas between states should temper regional price variation. However, price differences between locations frequently exceed the marginal cost of transmission, indicating that capacity constraints are binding. Gas pipelines are tightly regulated through both rate-of-return for pricing and a costly approval process, both of which could distort the firms' investment incentives. When combined, the two sides of the regulatory structure could be used in tandem to design incentives that promote efficient network growth. To understand how well the policy aligns incentives with social value, we develop a structural model of a pipeline firm's dynamic investment problem and estimate it nonparametrically using debiased machine learning. We then construct a measure of the social value of pipeline capital, based on a social planner model that ties the value of capacity expansion to regional price gaps. In most areas, the incentives of firms to invest under fixed rates of return exceed the social value of capital, highlighting the importance of costly approvals as a secondary tool to control investments.
