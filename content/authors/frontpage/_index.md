I am an economist and data scientist working in marketing science and operations at Chewy. Before joining Chewy, I worked for three years in the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/) and the [Centre for Innovative Data in Economic Research](https://economics.ubc.ca/cider/research-activity/) at the University of British Columbia. I earned a dual PhD in Economics and MS in Computational Science from Florida State University in 2022.

Most of my research falls into empirical industrial organization, behavioural economics, market design and political economy; my published work focuses on how platform design features, regulatory incentives, and market structure interact to determine the dynamics of social and economic networks, and examines the role of these endogenous network structures and their evolution in shaping economic outcomes.

These are complex systems; in addition to answering empirical questions my work frequently develops new computational methods that expand the frontier of what we can learn from data. This includes contributions to causal machine learning, structural estimation, and cybernetics.

Read more about my research [here](/research/), or in my [CV](uploads/Philip_Solimine_CV.pdf).

At UBC I taught graduate and undergraduate courses in quantitative economics and data science and developed many open-source course materials. For course notes and other information, see [here](/teaching/).
